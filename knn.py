#Problem Statement: -
#A glass manufacturing plant, uses different Earth elements to design a new glass based on customer requirements for that they would like to automate the process of classification as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually classify it, help the company reach its objective by correctly classifying the Earth elements, by using KNN Algorithm

#Problem Statement: -
#A National Park, in India is dealing with a problem of segregation of its species based on the different attributes it has so that they can have cluster of species together rather than  manually classify them, they have taken painstakingly  collected the data and would like you to help them out with a classification model for their  business objective to be achieved, by using KNN Algorithm  classify the different species and draft
